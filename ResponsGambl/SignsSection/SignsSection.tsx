          While it may be easier to notice signs of gambling problems in others, recognizing when
          your own gambling habits have become harmful can be much more difficult. Gambling-related
          harm isn't limited to financial issues — it can affect your mental health, relationships,
          and overall quality of life.

          Gambling dependency (also referred to as gambling addiction or gambling disorder) can
          gradually take control without obvious warning signs. At Brand, we encourage all players
          to stay informed and self-aware to ensure gambling remains a safe, fun, and entertaining
          activity.

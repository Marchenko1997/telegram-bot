            A loss limit helps you control how much you can afford to lose over a selected time
            frame — daily, weekly, or monthly. This limit is based on your net losses (your losses
            minus your winnings).

            A wager limit (also known as a bet limit) caps the total amount you can wager in a given
            period — day, week, or month. This limit is not <br className="hidden lg:block" />{' '}
            net-based, meaning it doesn't account for your winnings. Once you've hit your cap, you
            must wait until the period resets. <br className="hidden lg:block" /> You can decrease
            limits at any time and changes take effect immediately. However, any increases are
            subject to a 24-hour cooling-off period.

        spend time on other interests.

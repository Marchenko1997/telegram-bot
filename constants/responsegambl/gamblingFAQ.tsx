    question: '1. Isn’t problem gambling just about money?',
    answer: (
      <>
        Not at all. While financial issues are a visible consequence of gambling problems, problem
        gambling is a behavioural addiction. Even if a <br className="hidden lg:block" /> person
        clears their debts, they may still face emotional, psychological, or relational challenges
        caused by their gambling habits. Gambling <br className="hidden lg:block" /> harm runs
        deeper than money.

  {
    question: '2. Do I have to gamble frequently to have a gambling problem?',
    answer: (
      <>
        No. It’s not about how often you gamble, but rather the impact gambling has on your life. If
        your gambling is causing stress, anxiety, relationship breakdowns, financial difficulties,
        or affecting your well-being, it could be a sign of problem gambling — regardless of{' '}
        <br className="hidden lg:block" /> how often you place bets.

  {
    question: '3. How much do I have to lose before it’s considered a problem?',
    answer: (
      <>
        There’s no fixed amount. Problem gambling isn’t defined by losses, but by behaviour. Even if
        you’ve only lost small amounts, gambling may be an issue if it’s affecting your mental
        health, personal relationships, work, or sense of control.
      </>

  {
    question: '4. Who is most at risk of developing a gambling problem?',
    answer: (
      <>
        Anyone who gambles is potentially at risk, regardless of age, gender, income level,
        education, or background. However, factors such as <br className="hidden lg:block" />{' '}
        genetics, environment, mental health conditions, and early exposure to gambling may increase
        vulnerability to gambling addiction.
